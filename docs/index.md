## Overview

This Github repository contains the code for a Flask-based Python API that converts text data into a QR code. The API can be used to generate QR codes dynamically for any given text input. The project is designed for backend software engineers who need a simple, lightweight, and customizable solution for text-to-QR code conversion.

### Advantages of Using Flask:

Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is lightweight, easy to learn, and highly customizable. It is an ideal choice for this project because of the following reasons:

* **Lightweight:** Flask is a micro-framework, which means it has minimal dependencies and is easy to set up. This makes it a good choice for small projects that require quick prototyping.

* **Easy to learn:** Flask is designed to be simple and easy to learn. Its API is intuitive and well-documented, making it easy for developers to get started.

* **Highly customizable:** Flask is highly customizable, which means it can be tailored to the specific needs of this project. Flask provides a simple interface for adding middleware, authentication, and other custom functionality.

### Technical Specs:

The Flask-based Python API uses the qrcode library to generate QR codes. The API accepts text data as input and returns a PNG image of the corresponding QR code. The API can be accessed through a RESTful API endpoint, which can be integrated into any web application or mobile app.
